Migrating from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0

1) The terminology for certain classes and functions in the message Dispatch has
changed to be more clear. In most use cases, you probably did not work directly
with the classes in dispatch.js but just in case: MessageTarget was renamed to
MessageSpec and MessageHandler was renamed to MessageTarget. This was mostly
done to relieve confusion between the MessageHandler object created by the
Dispatch and the handler object it actually passed messages to.

The functions used by Citizens have also been renamed to be shorter and more
convenient to type:
"registerHandler" is now "subscribe"
"removeHandler" is now "unsubscribe"
"sendMessage" is now "send"

---------- Old code ----------
var myModel = new hemi.model.Model();
var myViewpoint = new hemi.view.Viewpoint();

var msgHandler = myModel.registerHandler(hemi.msg.load,
	myViewpoint,
	'cleanup');

myModel.sendMessage(hemi.msg.load, {});

myModel.removeHandler(msgHandler);

---------- New code ----------
var myModel = new hemi.model.Model();
var myViewpoint = new hemi.view.Viewpoint();

var msgTarget = myModel.subscribe(hemi.msg.load,
	myViewpoint,
	'cleanup');

myModel.send(hemi.msg.load, {});

myModel.unsubscribe(msgTarget);


2) The navigation control for multi-page HudDisplays has been moved out of Hemi
and into Hext. This removes the dependency it created on the image file for the
navigation buttons. The changes to your code should be minimal and are shown in
hud_demo.js.

At the top of your file you'll need an extra require statement:
o3djs.require('hext.hud.paging');

And the following line of code:
display.addPagingInfo = true;
should be replaced with this:
hext.hud.showPagingInfo();


3) The Hemi Console feature is now only visible by calling
hemi.console.addToPage() in your code. There is no need to add the DIV or link a
CSS file anymore.

4) The src field in messages is now the actual Citizen that sent the message
rather than just its id. This should make it more useful and shorten your code.

---------- Old code ----------
var msgTarget = hemi.msg.subscribe(hemi.msg.load,
	function(msg) {
		var sender = hemi.world.getCitizenById(msg.src);
		sender.doSomething();
	});

---------- New code ----------
var msgTarget = hemi.msg.subscribe(hemi.msg.load,
	function(msg) {
		msg.src.doSomething();
	});
	
5) The field of view for the Camera is now calculated in radians instead of
degrees. Use hemi.core.math.degToRad() to convert degrees to radians.

6) The name of a Model is no longer prepended to the names of all of its shapes.
