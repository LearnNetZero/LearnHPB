----------------------------Kuda 1.2.0 Release Notes----------------------------
2011 January 3

1. What's New
World Editor
* A new sidebar has been added to the far right and all tools have been updated to use the new sidebar
* Shapes can be defined and saved in the World Editor
* HUD can be defined and saved in the World Editor

* Audio effects can be scripted in the World Editor
* LargeGeometry option button to switch on that plugin option
* Fog can be defined
* Motions like translators and rotators can be defined and saved in the World Editor
Kuda Library
* Shapes are now proper Citizens that can send messages and be saved to Octane
* Revised terminology of message dispatch to be more clear (see Migration.txt)
* Multi-page HUD navigation control moved from Hemi to Hext
* Created HUD Theme class for easy display configuration
* Added setSize function for HudPages to manually set their size
* Added a video sample that offers two techniques to do video, one overlays, the other hides the 3d.
* Options to disable zooming and shift-click scanning added to camera
* Functions to programmatically rotate the camera in place or orbit about a point added
* Functions to translate, scale, and rotate texture uv-mapping
* Fog may be added to a world, with specified color, start distance, and ending distance
* Sprite changed image to frame, so there is setFrame along with the addFrame.

* Manips (draggable, turnable) can now be saved to Octane
* The src field of a message is now the Citizen rather than id (see Migration.txt)
* Baked lighting hemi.fx included, so you can change the material from diffuse sampling to emissive in your script using the library if you have a model with baked lighting.  The default effect is typically diffuse unless on export to collada you control that process.
* A new physics sample which integrates jiglib (experimental).
* Model has load and unload functions for resource management.

2. Bug Fixes
World Editor
* Preview uses hemi.loader.loadOctane to load the octane
* Model browser tool cleaned up
Kuda Library

----------------------------Kuda 1.1.1 Release Notes----------------------------
2010 November 11

1. What's New
Kuda Library
* Hext has a new house structure module that has high level objects Door and Window.  These were part of 1.1.0 but were not mentioned in "What's new".  These make it easy when using hemi manip's Rotator, Draggable, or Translator for doors, or windows.
* Improved CameraMoves sample with a new tour mode, in addition a curve can be displayed to show the flight path.

2. Bug Fixes
* IE loading "hext.tools" undefined fix.
* Numerous editor bug fixes.
* Octane samples are back and included in the samples, these were primarily built using the editor.

----------------------------Kuda 1.1.0 Release Notes----------------------------
2010 November 3

1. What's New
Kuda Library
* Refactored World and Citizens
* Refactored Message Dispatch for improved performance
* Refactored Messages to be more generic and reusable
* Penner equations for camera movement
* Hemi console for displaying log messages
* Camera movement along a curve
* Camera now sends moveToView Messages rather than Viewpoints sending them.
* Renamed hemi.loader module to hemi.octane.
* Created new hemi.loader module for loading resources like Octane, models, images, etc from file.
* Hemi.manip.Turnable: Click and drag to rotate objects
* Color and scale gradients on particle system can be set dynamically
* hemi.curve - Binds the camera light position to shaders light world position, so the particles react to the camera and main light position versus being dark on one side 
* hemi.model - Added a previous value to the data section of the hemi.msg.modelAnimation message making it possible to accurately trigger at a point in time on the curve
* hemi.shape - API to easily add shapes to the scene
* Pressure engine moved from Hemi to Hext library.
* Tools moved from Hemi to Hext library.
* Five new samples: Console, CameraMoves, Shapes, Lighting, and FadingWalls.
* Experimental IE9 beta support tested and the change is not implemented. (In o3djs/base.js line 582 //clientObject.eval(v8Init.toString())(o3djs.v8Initializer_, o3djs.v8InitializerArgs_);)

2. Bug Fixes
Kuda Library
* hemi.manip - Fixed issue in IE7 due to extraneous comma on object literal
* hemi.curve - Particle visibility at end of life

* Animations automatically reset when they finish.
* ParticleEmitter effects have a trigger function to show/hide them.

2. Bug Fixes
Kuda World Editor
* Selecting multiple objects and dragging them behaves as expected now.
* Fixed bug where selecting an Animation and then trying to create a new Animation edited the previously selected one instead.

* Fixed bug that would not allow you to create more than one MessageHandler with the same handler object.

Kuda Library
* Fixed initialization and clean up of World and Model.
