Contributing to Kuda

Kuda is a collaborative project and we encourage participation.  If
you think of features to add, bugs to fix, or improvements to make, we
welcome your input.  To become involved please send us a request at
dev@kuda.sri.com.

If you wish to contribute to the distribution we require that you to
complete and submit a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) along with
your first submission.  The purpose of this agreement is to clearly
define the terms under which intellectual property has been
contributed to the project and thereby allow us to defend the project
should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future
time.  The CLA is included with the distribution.
