<h1>Very Simple Scenario</h1>


   
<p>You are on the 4th floor of a new five story office building located on a suburban 
site in Chicago. </p>    
 
<p>It is about 1 pm on a hot summer day (e.g. the summer design day . It is VERY 
HOT in every zone on the 4th floor. The temperature in each of the 9 zones must 
be in the mid to high 80’s F. </p>    
 
<p>Your challenge is to take change the controls of the HVAC system to bring the 
zone temperatures into a more reasonable range, say between 70-78F. </p>    
 
<p>You are able to make changes to the set point temperatures for hea-ng and for 
cooling in each of the 9 zones.</p>  
<p>Hint: the cooling set point temperature should be at least 5 degrees higher than 
the hea-ng setpoint temperature.</p> 
 
<p>Good luck!</p>
 
<p>First: Click the “Start Simulation” button to start the simula-on. 
Second: Observe the inital temperatures in the zones streaming across the 
chart at the bottom right of the screen. 
Third:  Begin to change the set point temperatures.
